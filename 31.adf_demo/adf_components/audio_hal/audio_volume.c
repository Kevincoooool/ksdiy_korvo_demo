 * The speaker playback route is shown as the block diagram above. The speaker loudness is affected by both
 * audio Digital Gain and Analog Gain.
 *
 * Digital Gain:
 * Audio Process Gain: Audio Process, such as ALC, AGC, DRC target MAX Gain.
 * Codec DAC Volume: The audio codec DAC volume control, such as ES8311 DAC_Volume control register.
 *
 * Analog Gain:
 * PA Gain: The speaker power amplifier Gain, which is determined by the hardware circuit board.
 *
 * User can control the speaker playback volume by adjusting Codec DAC Volume.
 *
 * We use volume level (1-100) to represent the volume levels, level 100 is the MAX volume. We create a volume
 * mapping index table for the user to set the volume level through Codec DAC volume. The default mapping table
 * maps volume level(1-100) to Codec DAC Volume (-49.5dB, 0dB). The volume setting has 25 volume levels.
 * Level step is 4, and the corresponding to Codec DAC Volume Gain is 2 dB step. Normally, Codec DAC volume -50 dB
 * reproduces a minimal speaker loudness, and the 2 dB step allows the user to detect the volume change.

/**
 * The speaker playback route gain (Audio Process Gain + Codec DAC Volume + PA Gain) needs to ensure that the
 * speaker PA output is not saturated and exceeds the speaker rated power. We define the maximum route gain
 * as MAX_GAIN. To ensure the speaker PA output is not saturated, MAX_GAIN can be calculated simply by the formula.
 *    MAX_GAIN = 20 * log(Vpa/Vdac)
 *    Vpa: PA power supply
 *    Vdac: Codec DAC power supply
 * e.g., Vpa = 5V, Vdac = 3.3V, then MAX_GAIN = 20 * log(5/3.3) = 3.6 dB.
 * If the speaker rated power is lower than the speaker PA MAX power, MAX_GAIN should be defined according to
 * the speaker rated power.
