Function Description
Mixing less or equal than`SOURCE_NUM_MAX` of input streams into output stream with the correspondingly gains. And the number of channels of output stream can be set. refer to `esp_downmix_output_type_t`.
The downmix process has 3 work status:
* Bypass Downmixing -- Only the first streams will be played;
* Switch on Downmixing -- All input streams will enter the transition period, during which the gains of these streams will be changed from the original level to the target level; then enter the stable period, sharing a same target gain;
* Switch off Downmixing -- All input streams and the others stream will enter the transition period, during which the gains of these streams will be changed back to their original levels; then enter the stable period, with their original gains, respectively. After that, the audio device enters the bypass status.
Note that, the sample rates of all input streams must be the same. Otherwise, an error occurs.
