# Multi-format recording routine

- [中文版本](./README_CN.md)
- Basic Example: ![alt text](../../../docs/_static/level_basic.png "Basic Example")

## Example Brief

This example mainly demonstrates the use of WAV, OPUS, AMRNB and AMRWB encoders pipeline. Voice data is read from the i2s stream, encoded by the encoder, and finally written into the microSD card by the fatfs stream.

This example supports four audio encoders: WAV, OPUS, AMRNB and AMRWB. The WAV encoder is selected by default to encode the recording, and save the recording file to the microSD card.

## Environment Setup

### Hardware Required

A microSD card needs to be prepared and inserted into the development board in advance for this example.

This example runs on the boards that are marked with a green checkbox in the [table](../../README.md#compatibility-of-examples-with-espressif-audio-boards). Please remember to select the board in menuconfig as discussed in Section [Configuration](#configuration) below.


## Example Set Up

### Default IDF Branch
This example supports IDF release/v3.3 and later branches. By default, it runs on ADF's built-in branch `$ADF_PATH/esp-idf`.

### Configuration
The default board for this example is `ESP32-Lyrat V4.3`, if you need to run this example on other development boards, you need to select the configuration of the development board in menuconfig, for example, select `ESP32-Lyrat-Mini V1.1`.

```c
menuconfig > Audio HAL > ESP32-Lyrat-Mini V1.1
```

This example needs to enable FATFS long file name support also. For example, file names like `rec.opus` are beyond the default `8.3 naming` specification.

```c
menuconfig > Component config > FAT Filesystem support > Long filename support
```

The default encoder of this example is WAV. If you change to another encoder, you need to select the encoder in the `menuconfig`, such as the OPUS encoder.

```c
menuconfig > Example configuration > Encoding type of recording file > opus encoder
```

### Build and Flash
Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output (replace `PORT` with your board's serial port name):

```c
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use  [ESP-IDF Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v4.2/esp32/index.html) to build projects.

## How to use the Example

### Example Functionality
After the routine starts to run, it will print the following countdown prompt and prompt that the recording has started.

```c
I (655) RECORDING_TO_SDCARD: [ 5 ] Start audio_pipeline
I (665) RECORDING_TO_SDCARD: [ 6 ] Listen for all pipeline events, record for 10 Seconds
I (1725) RECORDING_TO_SDCARD: [ * ] Recording ... 1
I (2725) RECORDING_TO_SDCARD: [ * ] Recording ... 2
I (3735) RECORDING_TO_SDCARD: [ * ] Recording ... 3
```

At the end of the routine, the following is printed. At this time, you can remove the microSD card and use a computer player to play the audio file. The audio file is named like `rec.wav` or `rec.opus`.

```c
W (10975) RECORDING_TO_SDCARD: [ * ] Stop event received
I (10975) RECORDING_TO_SDCARD: [ 7 ] Stop audio_pipeline
E (10975) AUDIO_ELEMENT: [opus] Element already stopped
E (10975) AUDIO_ELEMENT: [res] Element already stopped
E (10985) AUDIO_ELEMENT: [file] Element already stopped
W (10995) AUDIO_PIPELINE: There are no listener registered
W (10995) AUDIO_ELEMENT: [file] Element has not create when AUDIO_ELEMENT_TERMINATE
W (11005) AUDIO_ELEMENT: [i2s] Element has not create when AUDIO_ELEMENT_TERMINATE
W (11015) AUDIO_ELEMENT: [res] Element has not create when AUDIO_ELEMENT_TERMINATE
W (11025) AUDIO_ELEMENT: [opus] Element has not create when AUDIO_ELEMENT_TERMINATE
```
