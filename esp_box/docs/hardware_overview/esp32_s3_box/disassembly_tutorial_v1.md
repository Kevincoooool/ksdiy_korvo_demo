### Step-by-step Guide

- The first step is to remove the touch display that is glued to the frame. Please use a "Hot Air Blower" perpendicularly on the edge of the touch screen to loosen the adhesive materials. 
- Next, use the "Flat-Head Screwdriver" or "Triangle Plastic Pry Opening Tool" to pry off the touch screen. Please be careful, as you may damage the FPC cable and the glass cover of the touch screen when removing the touch screen from the development board.

- While tearing off the touch screen, you will observe the touch panel is connected to the mainboard by two FPC cables, 8 pin and 20 pin, respectively. Unlock the two FPC connectors and take down the whole touch screen.

> **Note**: The middle frame is 3D printed, it might be tight while removing the middle frame from the case. Try to open the snap-fit from the edge. 

- You will see a microphone sub-board attached to the back of the middle frame. The mic sub-board is connected to the mainboard through a 6 pin FPC cable. Unscrew the two screws of the mic sub-board and unlock one side of the 6 pin FPC cable to remove the sub-board completely.
